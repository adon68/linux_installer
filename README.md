# Linux Installer

A GTK3-based GUI installer for an audience that's used to Windows installers.
When all you would _really_ need is `unzip`, but want a nice user experience
nonetheless. Imitates the look and feel of
[NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Screenshots) installers.

A commandline or "*silent*" mode is available as well.

## Requirements

* Clone the repository into
   `$GOPATH/src/github.com/grandchild/linux_installer`

* A working Go installation, see the
[official installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for information on
how to install Go on your system

* Make sure your installation works, by following the instructions "*Test your
installation*" on the installation page.

* The `make` & `zip` commands, simply install their packages:
    * `make`
    * `zip`

* On RPM-based systems (Centos, Ubuntu, etc) the following dev-packages need to be
  installed as well
    * `libgtk-3-dev`
    * `libglib2.0-dev`

* The `rice` command from go-rice. Install it with:

```bash
    go install github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice/rice
```


## Usage

This project creates an installer *builder* (altough it can create test installers
directly) with which one can create installers for customers.

To create the builder run

```bash
    make clean linux-builder.tar.gz
```

You can then copy and extract the linux-builder onto another system, fill the contained
data folder with files, edit the `config.yml` with any information needed, and inside
the "*linux-builder/*" directory run

```bash
    make OUTPUT=<Your installer name here> VERSION=<Your program version here>
```

So for example something like

```bash
    make OUTPUT=Setup_ExampleApp_v1.1
```

would create a new file *Setup.bin* which installs the software and shows version 1.1 in
the UI.

## Testing

To simply build and test an installer in the main project, run
```bash
    make clean run
```


## Hacking

### Code Structure

This part serves as a general overview. For detailed information on structures and
functions, refer to the documentation in the code, which can also be presented more
readably in the browser through
[`godoc`](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc):

Run
```bash
    godoc github.com/grandchild/linux_installer
```
and then go to: http://localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/grandchild/linux_installer/?m=all


The code's entry point is the `main()` function in `main/main.go`, which simply calls
the actual main function which is `run.go`'s `Run()`
function[<sup>(1)</sup>](#anchor-1).

All GUI code is placed in its own "main" package, inside the `gui/` folder, because it
is compiled separately as a [Go plugin](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/) (a Go-specific
kind of *.so* dynamic library). This allows compiling the installer without linking to
GTK3 explicitly, which in turn allows running the installer on older Linux
distributions, and falling back gracefully to an error message and allowing CLI
installation mode. If the code would not be separated out into the plugin, the installer
would always fail on systems without GTK3, reporting only a linker error and without
recourse.


#### Main Go Files

`run.go` is the entry point and parses commandline flags and decides whether to run in
GUI or CLI mode.

`install.go` provides the `Installer` type that performs the actual installation. It is
used by all installation modes.

`install_linux.go` contains the Linux-specific system calls and application-menu,
uninstaller and pre-/post-hooks (which are all OS-specific).

`gui/gui.go` describes the GUI's behavior. It contains the event handlers at the top,
followed by the constructor. The second half of the code are various functions the GUI
code uses, such as switching from one screen to the next, or checking on the installer's
progress.

`config.go` defines the structure for the config.yml file. It is used throughout the
code, for accessing variables and options.


#### Helper Go Files

`resources.go` is the interface around go-rice, the library used for appending data to
the compiled executableâ€”creating the packaged installer. Refer to the [go-rice
documentation](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice) for more details.

`translate.go` implements internationalization functions, and uses language files inside
`resources/languages/` to render any user-facing string in the chosen language of the
installer. It also detects the system locale to allow meaningful user communication
before a language can be chosen.

`variables.go` provides a simple templating engine to expand variables inside strings.
This can even be done recursively (i.e. a variable *value* may contain a variable
reference as well).

`gui/gui_utils.go` contains wrappers for retrieving various GTK3 widget types from the
gui definition file. Go [famously has no generics](https://golang.org/doc/faq#generics),
making this list of similar functions necessary. They all do the same thing, which is
casting a widget loaded from the builder into the desired type.


#### Metadata

`doc.go` Contains a general description of the installer package, accessible through
[`go doc`](https://golang.org/cmd/doc/) or
[`godoc`](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc) (See above).

`go.mod` & `go.sum` Contain a list of dependencies, their versions and checksums. Used
with [`go mod`](https://golang.org/cmd/mod/).

**Note:** *`go mod` only works if your Go version is* 1.11 *or higher. Use `go version`
to check.*


#### Unused Go Files

`install_windows.go` Roughly implements the functions from `install_linux` but is
largely untested since this installer is not used on Windows, since it would need to be
shipped with GTK3 libraries. Which would defeat the purpose of having a packaged
installer.

`tui.go` A tentative implementation of an ncurses-based terminal-graphical UI for the
installer. Incomplete. The CLI mode serves well enough.


### Installer Style & Layout

The GUI layout of the installer is specified in the `gui.glade`. This file can be edited
with [Glade](https://glade.gnome.org/), a WYSIWYG GTK3 UI editor.

The layout consists of the main installer frame and a dialog box, asking for
confirmation before exiting the installer.

The installer frame consists mainly of the "Stack" of screens that the installer can go
through. Not all have to be visited (e.g. installation failure), and not necessarily in
order (although they are mostly run through sequentially).


### New Installer Screens

A new installer screen is a two-step process:

1. *Layout*: Create a new installer screen in `resources/gui/gui.glade`
1. *Behavior*: Add screen to `screenHandlers()` inside `gui/gui.go`

#### Layout

In the list of screens in Glade, right-click on the screen after which you want to
insert your new screen, and select "*Insert Page After*" at the bottom of the context
menu. Double-click inside the resulting empty space and select GtkBox to create a layout
base for the new screen. Give the Box an ID in the details panel on the right in the
"General" tab. This ID is needed in the next step.

You can then design the inside of the Box however you like. Remember to add IDs to
relevant elements in order to reach them from the behavior code.

#### Behavior

In `gui/gui.go` inside `screenHandlers()` add a new section for the screen like this:

```go
    {
        name: "myscreen",
        before: func() {
            // ...
        },
        after: func() {
            // ...
        },
        undo: func() bool {
            // ...
        }
    },
```

The "*name*" key is the ID you chose in the layout step. The "*before*", "*after*" and
"*undo*" keys are documented in the documentation for the ScreenHandler struct a little
bit earlier in `gui/gui.go`. Refer to that for details.

If a function for a key is empty, the key can be omitted completely.


### New Language Translation

In short: Add a new file named `xx.yml` inside `resources/languages/` (or better, copy
`en.yml`), where "*xx*" is the language's two-letter [ISO
639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) code. Then translate all
messages. The language should now be available in the language selection in the GUI and
the help text in the CLI mode.

E.g. in order to add French, create and translate `resources/languages/fr.yml`.


## Footnotes

### (1)
The reason for the existence of `main/main.go` is that a Go program's main function has
to be placed inside a package called "main". But the installer package with most of the
code should be called "installer", not "main" in order to behave more like an importable
library. Thus the slightly awkward cage for main.
